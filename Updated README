Project README

The aim of this project was to create a smartphone controlled servo motor which could function as a dispenar.
Using the IOT platform Blynk and a Raspberry Pi as the software and hardware of the project,
constantly exchanging data over the Internet by the use Of Virtual pins.
Second feature was the use of a Motion senser which when detecting motion would also influence servo motors movement.
As the final feature was the use of a Virtual LED in the Blynk app which would change colour when motion was detected.
The programming language used was Python through the nano script editor in the Raspberry Pi's terminal.
