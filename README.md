# IotPRojectsEM1
Smart dispenser project for Project semester module.

The idea of my project was to create a simple protoype of a servo motor that will move at a 180.C angle through the use of a raspberry Pi and the Iot platform, Blynk. 

Blynk acts as a third-party platform which allows for the user to contact raspberry pi through the use of Blynk on your Android phone. The connection then allows for the user to control the dispensar through their phone.

The code used to contact Blynk and tell the servo motor to move is stored in the linux terminal in a simple text editor(nano).
